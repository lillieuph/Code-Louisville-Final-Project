                <p>Pokémon Pikachu, also known as Pocket Pikachu in Japan, is a series of two portable Pokémon digital pets (similar to Tamagotchi) featuring the famous yellow electric-type Pokémon, Pikachu. Released on March 27, 1998, in Japan (November 2, 1998), in North America)</p>

                <p>The first release, a yellow unit resembling a Game Boy, features a black and white LCD screen used to display animations of Pikachu's activities. Gameplay differs slightly from other portable virtual pets in that Pikachu does not need to be fed, watered, or cleaned up after. Instead, the Pokémon Pikachu unit can be strapped to a belt and used as a pedometer. With every twenty steps it counts, the Pokémon Pikachu credits its user with one watt, a virtual currency used to buy Pikachu presents. Additional activities become available as the player spends more time with their virtual Pikachu. If neglected, Pikachu will express anger and eventually refuse to recognize the player.</p>

                <p>The second release, Pokémon Pikachu 2 GS, is available in clear and silver casing with a color display featuring more animations. It features an infrared port for interacting with Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal via the Mystery Gift option, which utilizes the Game Boy Color's built-in infrared communication port. This allows players to trade watts for items in the Game Boy games. Although there is a limitation on how much the Mystery Gift mode can be used between Game Boy cartridges, Pokémon Pikachu's only limit is that of available watts. Watts can also be sent to other Pokémon Pikachu 2 units.</p>
